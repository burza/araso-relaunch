        %p.about-me I have a very atypical path both personally and professionally. I was born in Cameroun and raised in 6 different countries and 3 continents. I speak English, French and Spanish fluently. I have been good at math and science since my childhood, studying and obtaining a diploma in Electronics Engineering. After working in that field for a couple of years, I decided to learn design on my own and have been working as a designer and developer since July 2007.
        %p.big One of the greatest things about being a designer with an engineer background is that not only can I take care of the graphical aspects of a project, but can also fully understand, participate and even take care of the highly technical aspects of those projects.
